## Introduction

**Key features:**

✅ **Reliable Data Source**

✅ **SQL-First Interface**  
Query everything in DuckDB using plain SQL - no wrappers, no fuss.

✅ **Blazing Fast**  
[DuckDB's OLAP engine](https://duckdb.org/) + [cache_httpfs](https://duckdb.org/community_extensions/extensions/cache_httpfs.html) extensions for low-latency analytics.
