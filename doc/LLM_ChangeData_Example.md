# Example: Using LLMs to Analyze Key Metric Changes and Their Drivers in Earnings Call Transcripts
> [!NOTE]
> Generally speaking, during an earnings call, management will disclose the key financial changes for the quarter and the reasons behind them. These changes are also frequently the focus of repeated questioning and attention from analysts during the Q&A session. Manually reading through the lengthy transcript to analyze these changes and their causes can be very time-consuming.
> 
> This document introduces on how to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze these changes and their root causes. In contrast, having an LLM perform the same task takes only tens of seconds and provides a clear, traceable analysis process for your review.


## Prerequisites
To run this example, you need: An OpenAI-compatible API key (`OPEN_AI_API_KEY`), A LLM model with a thinking capability.

Our tests show that even free, small-parameter models(e.g. `Qwen/Qwen3-8B`) can deliver excellent results.

> [!TIP]
> You can obtain a free API for small-parameter models from [SiliconFlow's Chinese website](https://www.siliconflow.cn/pricing).
> 
> For higher accuracy and performance, consider using larger models from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-api/), [DeepSeek](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/), [QWen](https://qwen.ai/apiplatform), or [Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs).

## Example Code
**Below is an example that analyzes key quarterly financial changes and their causes, using an LLM on earnings call transcripts.**

```python
from openai import OpenAI
from defeatbeta_api.data.ticker import Ticker
from defeatbeta_api.client.openai_conf import OpenAIConfiguration

# Initialize the Ticker
ticker = Ticker("AMD")

# Fetch earnings call transcripts
transcripts = ticker.earning_call_transcripts()

# Configure the OpenAI client
llm = OpenAI(
    api_key="OPEN_AI_API_KEY",  # Replace with your OPEN_AI_API_KEY
    base_url="OPEN_AI_API_END_POINT"  # Replace with your OPEN_AI_API_END_POINT
)

# analyzes key quarterly financial changes and their causes for Q2 2025 with llm
res = transcripts.analyze_financial_metrics_change_for_this_quarter_with_ai(
  2025, 
  2, 
  llm, 
  OpenAIConfiguration(model='Qwen/Qwen3-8B'))
print(res.to_string())
```

â”‚                                                                                                                                                                                                                    â”‚
â”‚  Okay, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to extract the original metrics from the earnings call transcript. The user mentioned that the original_metrics should include the metric names, change       â”‚
â”‚  descriptions, speaker, and paragraph number. Also, the change field must not include any projections or forecasts, just the actual figures mentioned.                                                             â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                                                                                                                                    â”‚
â”‚  Starting with paragraph 3, Lisa mentions "Second quarter revenue increased 32% year-over-year to a record $7.7 billion." So that's a revenue metric with a 32% increase. The speaker is Lisa T. Su, paragraph 3.  â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                                                                                                                                    â”‚
â”‚  Next, she talks about "over $1 billion in free cash flow." So free cash flow is another metric, increased by more than $1 billion. Still in paragraph 3, same speaker.                                            â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                                                                                                                                    â”‚
â”‚  Then, "Data Center segment revenue increased 14% year-over-year to $3.2 billion." That's a Data Center revenue metric. Speaker Lisa, paragraph 3.                                                                 â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                                                                                                                                    â”‚
â”‚  In paragraph 4, Jean Hu says "revenue increased 3% sequentially due to strong growth in the Client and the Gaming segment." So sequential revenue increase of 3%, but the user wants the change field to be the   â”‚
â”‚  actual figures. Wait, the original_metrics should capture the change from the previous period. The first part of the transcript mentions Q2 revenue was $7.7B, and in paragraph 4, the Q3 guidance is $8.7B. But  â”‚
â”‚  the actual change in the second quarter compared to the previous quarter is mentioned as 3% sequential growth. However, the user specified that the change field should reflect the current quarter's difference  â”‚
â”‚  from the previous period, not the guidance. So in paragraph 4, the sequential increase is 3%, but the actual change in Q2 compared to Q1 isn't directly stated. Wait, the user's instruction says to exclude      â”‚
â”‚  projections, so maybe the sequential increase mentioned in paragraph 4 is part of the actual results? Let me check again.                                                                                         â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                                                                                                                                    â”‚
â”‚  Looking at paragraph 4, Jean says "Revenue increased 3% sequentially due to strong growth in the Client and the Gaming segment, partially offset by the Data Center revenue decrease due to export controls." So  â”‚
â”‚  the sequential increase is 3%, but the actual change from Q1 to Q2 is not explicitly given. Wait, the original_metrics need to capture the change from the previous period. The first paragraph mentions Q2       â”‚
â”‚  revenue is $7.7B, which is a year-over-year increase. But for the sequential change, the user might be referring to Q2 to Q3, but the question is about the original_metrics, which are based on the              â”‚
â”‚  transcript's actual figures. Wait, the original_metrics are for the current quarter, which is Q2. So the change should be the difference between Q2 and Q1. However, the transcript doesn't explicitly state the  â”‚
â”‚  Q1 revenue. Wait, the user's example includes "Second quarter revenue increased 32% year-over-year to a record $7.7 billion," so that's a year-over-year change. But for the sequential change, the transcript    â”‚
â”‚  mentions "revenue increased 3% sequentially" in paragraph 4, but that's part of the guidance for Q3. Wait, the user says to exclude any projections, so maybe the sequential increase mentioned in paragraph 4    â”‚
â”‚  is not part of the actual Q2 results but part of the Q3 guidance. Therefore, the actual Q2 to Q1 change isn't directly stated. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me check again.                                  â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                                                                                                                                    â”‚
â”‚  Wait, the original_metrics are for the current quarter, which is Q2. The change should be the actual figures from the previous period. The transcript mentions that Q2 revenue was $7.7B, which is a 32% YoY      â”‚
â”‚  increase. But the sequential change (Q2 vs Q1) isn't directly given. However, in paragraph 4, Jean says "revenue increased 3% sequentially," which refers to Q3 compared to Q2. So that's part of the guidance,   â”‚
â”‚  not the actual Q2 change. Therefore, maybe the sequential change isn't included in the original_metrics because it's a projection. So perhaps the only actual changes are the YoY figures.                        â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                                                                                                                                    â”‚
â”‚  Wait, the user's instruction says to exclude any projections, guidance, or forecasts. So the sequential increase mentioned in paragraph 4 is part of the guidance for Q3, so it shouldn't be included.            â”‚
â”‚  Therefore, the original_metrics would only include the YoY changes. Let me check other paragraphs.                                                                                                                â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                                                                                                                                    â”‚
â”‚  In paragraph 3, Lisa mentions "Data Center segment revenue increased 14% year-over-year to $3.2 billion." So that's a YoY increase. Then, in paragraph 4, Jean says "Data Center segment revenue decreased 12%    â”‚
â”‚  sequentially due to the impact of the export controls on MI308." But that's a sequential decrease, which is part of the Q3 guidance. So again, that's a projection. So maybe the original_metrics only include    â”‚
â”‚  the actual figures from the current quarter (Q2) compared to the previous quarter (Q1) if they are mentioned. But the transcript doesn't state the Q1 revenue. Wait, the user's example includes "Second quarter  â”‚
â”‚  revenue increased 32% year-over-year to a record $7.7 billion," which is a YoY change. So perhaps the original_metrics should only include the YoY changes, as the sequential changes are part of the guidance.   â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                                                                                                                                    â”‚
â”‚  Wait, the user's instruction says to extract the change from the current quarter compared to the previous period. So for Q2, the previous period is Q1. But the transcript doesn't mention the Q1 figures.        â”‚
â”‚  However, in paragraph 3, Lisa says "Second quarter revenue increased 32% year-over-year to a record $7.7 billion," which is a YoY change. Also, in paragraph 4, Jean says "revenue increased 3% sequentially due  â”‚
â”‚  to strong growth in the Client and the Gaming segment, partially offset by the Data Center revenue decrease due to export controls." But that's the sequential change from Q2 to Q3, which is part of the         â”‚
â”‚  guidance. So that's a projection. Therefore, the original_metrics should only include the actual figures from Q2 compared to Q1, but since Q1 isn't mentioned, maybe the only actual change is the YoY figures.   â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                                                                                                                                    â”‚
â”‚  Wait, maybe the user is okay with the YoY changes as the original_metrics, even if the sequential change isn't explicitly stated. Let me check the example again. The user's example includes "revenue increased  â”‚
â”‚  32% year-over-year to a record $7.7 billion" as a metric. So that's the original_metrics. Then, the processed_metrics would have direction and reason based on that.                                              â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                                                                                                                                    â”‚
â”‚  So for the original_metrics, I need to find all the actual figures mentioned in the transcript for the current quarter (Q2) compared to the previous period (which could be Q1 or the same quarter last year).    â”‚
â”‚  Let me go through each paragraph again.                                                                                                                                                                           â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                                                                                                                                    â”‚
â”‚  Paragraph 3: "Second quarter revenue increased 32% year-over-year to a record $7.7 billion" â€“ that's a YoY increase. So that's one metric: Revenue, change is "increased 32% year-over-year to a record $7.7      â”‚
â”‚  billion", speaker Lisa, paragraph 3.                                                                                                                                                                              â”‚

â”‚  "Free cash flow was over $1 billion" â€“ that's a metric. So Free Cash Flow, change is "over $1 billion", speaker Lisa, paragraph 3.                                                                                â”‚

â”‚  "gross margin was 54%, marking our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion." So that's a gross margin metric, with the change being "marking our sixth consecutive quarter of                â”‚

â”‚  Wait, the user's example includes "Second quarter revenue increased 32% year-over-year to a record $7.7 billion" as a metric. So the change is the YoY increase. Similarly, "gross margin was 54%, marking our    â”‚
â”‚  sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion led by a richer product mix." So that's a gross margin metric, with the change being the 54% figure and the year-over-year expansion.                â”‚

â”‚  In paragraph 4, "Gross margin was 43%, down 10 points from 53% a year ago." So that's a gross margin metric, but the change is the 43% figure. Wait, the original_metrics should have the change as the actual    â”‚
â”‚  figures. So the gross margin in Q2 is 43%, which is a decrease from 53% YoY. But the user's example includes "gross margin was 54%, marking our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion."    â”‚
â”‚  Wait, that's conflicting. Let me check the exact wording again.                                                                                                                                                   â”‚

â”‚  In paragraph 3: "Excluding the $800 million inventory write-down related to data center AI export controls, gross margin was 54%, marking our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion led    â”‚
â”‚  by a richer product mix." So the gross margin is 54% in Q2, which is a YoY increase. But the actual previous quarter's gross margin isn't stated. However, the user's example includes "marking our sixth         â”‚
â”‚  consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion," which implies that the previous quarter's gross margin was lower. But the exact number isn't given. Wait, but in paragraph 4, Jean says "Gross margin    â”‚
â”‚  was 43%, down 10 points from 53% a year ago." So that's a YoY decrease. But that's for Q2. Wait, this is confusing. Let me parse this carefully.                                                                  â”‚

â”‚  In paragraph 3, Lisa says "gross margin was 54%... sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion." So that's a YoY increase. But in paragraph 4, Jean says "Gross margin was 43%, down 10 points   â”‚
â”‚  from 53% a year ago." Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the 54% is the non-GAAP gross margin, and the 43% is the GAAP gross margin. Because in paragraph 4, Jean mentions "non-GAAP gross margin would  â”‚
â”‚  have been approximately 54%." So the GAAP gross margin is 43%, which is down from 53% YoY. But the original_metrics should include the change as per the transcript. So the GAAP gross margin is 43%, down 10     â”‚
â”‚  points from 53% YoY. But the non-GAAP is 54%, which is an expansion. So maybe the original_metrics should include both GAAP and non-GAAP? But the user's example includes "gross margin was 54%," so perhaps the  â”‚
â”‚  non-GAAP is the one they want.                                                                                                                                                                                    â”‚

â”‚  Wait, but the free cash flow in paragraph 3 is "over $1 billion" and in paragraph 4 it's "record of $1.2 billion." So that's a change from the previous quarter. But the exact percentage isn't given. So the     â”‚
â”‚  change would be "record of $1.2 billion" but that's not a percentage. However, the user's example includes both percentage and absolute figures. So maybe the change is "over $1 billion" and "record of $1.2     â”‚
â”‚  billion" as separate entries? Or is it the same metric with different figures?                                                                                                                                    â”‚

â”‚  Alternatively, maybe the free cash flow is a single metric, and the change is "record of $1.2 billion" which implies an increase from the previous quarter. But without the previous quarter's figure, it's hard  â”‚
â”‚  to quantify. However, the user's instruction says to include the change as per the transcript, so if the transcript says "record of $1.2 billion," that's the change.                                             â”‚

â”‚  Similarly, the Data Center segment revenue increased 14% YoY, so direction is "up," and the reason is "robust demand across our EPYC portfolio to power cloud and enterprise workloads and increasingly for       â”‚

â”‚  The free cash flow is "over $1 billion" which is an increase, so direction "up," and the reason might be "sustained demand for our prior-generation EPYC processors" or something else. Wait, the reason for the  â”‚
â”‚  free cash flow increase isn't explicitly stated, but the context is that they had a record free cash flow. So the reason could be "sustained demand for EPYC and Ryzen processors, and strong performance in the  â”‚
â”‚  Data Center and Client segments."                                                                                                                                                                                 â”‚

â”‚  In paragraph 3, "we delivered over $1 billion in free cash flow" and "free cash flow was a record of $1.2 billion" in paragraph 4. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, paragraph 3 says "we delivered over $1         â”‚
â”‚  billion in free cash flow" and paragraph 4 says "free cash flow was a record of $1.2 billion." So the free cash flow in Q2 is $1.2B, which is a record. So the change is "record of $1.2 billion," but the        â”‚
â”‚  previous quarter's figure isn't given. However, the user's instruction says to include the change as per the transcript. So the change for free cash flow is "record of $1.2 billion," which implies an increase  â”‚
