# Example: Using LLMs to Analyze Key Metric Changes and Their Drivers in Earnings Call Transcripts
> [!NOTE]
> Generally speaking, during an earnings call, management will disclose the key financial changes for the quarter and the reasons behind them. These changes are also frequently the focus of repeated questioning and attention from analysts during the Q&A session. Manually reading through the lengthy transcript to analyze these changes and their causes can be very time-consuming.
> 
> This document introduces on how to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze these changes and their root causes. In contrast, having an LLM perform the same task takes only tens of seconds and provides a clear, traceable analysis process for your review.


## Prerequisites
To run this example, you need: 
1. An OpenAI-compatible API key (`OPEN_AI_API_KEY`)
2. A LLM model with a function call tools capability.
3. A LLM model with a thinking capability.

> [!TIP]
> Our tests were conducted using the [Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking) model, achieving over 99% recall and 100% accuracy.
> 
> For optimal results, it is recommended to use large language models with large parameters.

## Example Code
### Code

```python
from openai import OpenAI
from defeatbeta_api.data.ticker import Ticker
from defeatbeta_api.client.openai_conf import OpenAIConfiguration

# Initialize the Ticker
ticker = Ticker("AMD")

# Fetch earnings call transcripts
transcripts = ticker.earning_call_transcripts()

# Configure the OpenAI client
llm = OpenAI(
    api_key="OPEN_AI_API_KEY",  # Replace with your OPEN_AI_API_KEY
    base_url="OPEN_AI_API_END_POINT"  # Replace with your OPEN_AI_API_END_POINT
)

# analyzes key quarterly financial changes and their causes for Q2 2025 with llm
res = transcripts.analyze_financial_metrics_change_for_this_quarter_with_ai(
  2025, 
  2, 
  llm, 
  OpenAIConfiguration(model='Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking'))
print(res.to_string())
```

â”‚                                                                                                                                                                                                                    â”‚
â”‚  Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the user wants me to analyze every sentence in the provided earnings call transcripts and extract key sentences that describe financial metric changes compared to previous  â”‚
â”‚  periods. The tool provided is extract_sentences, which requires identifying sentences with figures that changed year-over-year (YoY) or quarter-over-quarter (QoQ).                                               â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                                                                                                                                    â”‚
â”‚  First, I need to go through each paragraph and check each sentence for financial metrics. Let me start by looking at the transcript structure. The transcript is divided into paragraphs with speakers, and each  â”‚
â”‚  paragraph has multiple sentences.                                                                                                                                                                                 â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                                                                                                                                    â”‚
â”‚  Let me start with paragraph 1. The operator is welcoming, so probably no financial data here. Paragraph 2: Matthew Ramsay mentions the press release and non-GAAP measures, but no actual numbers yet. Then Lisa  â”‚
â”‚  Su's part in paragraph 3 is where the real financials start.                                                                                                                                                      â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                                                                                                                                    â”‚
â”‚  Looking at Lisa Su's sentences: "Second quarter revenue increased 32% year-over-year to a record $7.7 billion..." That's a YoY increase. So that's a key sentence. Also, "Excluding the $800 million inventory    â”‚
â”‚  write-down... gross margin was 54%..." Wait, but the write-down is a charge, so the actual gross margin excluding that is 54%, but the reported gross margin might be lower. However, the sentence says "gross    â”‚
â”‚  margin was 54%", so that's a factual figure. But need to check if it's actual or projected. Since it's the second quarter results, it's factual.                                                                  â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                                                                                                                                    â”‚
â”‚  Then she mentions Data Center segment revenue increased 14% YoY to $3.2 billion. That's another key sentence. Also, "Revenue declined year-over-year as U.S. export restrictions effectively eliminated MI308     â”‚
â”‚  sales to China..." So revenue decline YoY for Data Center AI business.                                                                                                                                            â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                                                                                                                                    â”‚
â”‚  In the Client and Gaming section: "segment revenue increased 69% year-over-year to $3.6 billion..." That's a YoY increase. Then "Client revenue increased 67% year-over-year to $2.5 billion..." Another YoY      â”‚
â”‚  figure.                                                                                                                                                                                                           â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                                                                                                                                    â”‚
â”‚  Embedded segment: "Revenue decreased 4% year-over-year to $824 million." So a YoY decrease.                                                                                                                       â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                                                                                                                                    â”‚
â”‚  Moving to Jean Hu's part in paragraph 4: "We delivered record revenue of $7.7 billion, exceeding the middle point of our guidance, up 32% year-over-year..." Again, same as Lisa's statement. Then "Revenue       â”‚
â”‚  increased 3% sequentially due to strong growth in the Client and the Gaming segment, partially offset by the Data Center revenue decrease due to export controls." So sequential increase here.                   â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                                                                                                                                    â”‚
â”‚  Gross margin was 43%, down 10 points from 53% a year ago. So YoY decrease. But the note says excluding the $800 million charge, it would have been 54%. So the actual reported gross margin is 43%, which is a    â”‚
â”‚  factual figure.                                                                                                                                                                                                   â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                                                                                                                                    â”‚
â”‚  Operating expenses increased 32% YoY. Operating income was $897 million, 12% margin vs $1.3 billion or 22% a year ago. So YoY changes in operating income and margin.                                             â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                                                                                                                                    â”‚
â”‚  Then segment details: Data Center revenue $3.2 billion up 14% YoY. Client and Gaming revenue $3.6 billion up 69% YoY. Embedded revenue $824 million down 4% YoY.                                                  â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                                                                                                                                    â”‚
â”‚  Jean also mentions third quarter outlook: "revenue to be approximately $8.7 billion, plus or minus $300 million. The midpoint of our guidance represents approximately 28% year-over-year revenue growth..." So   â”‚
â”‚  this is a projection, so is_factual would be N. But the user's tool says to return "Y" if factual (already occurred), "N" otherwise. So the guidance is future, so is_factual is N.                               â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                                                                                                                                    â”‚
â”‚  Wait, the user's instruction says: "Return 'Y' if the content of `sentence` is factual (already occurred), and 'N' otherwise (for projections, guidance, expectation or forecasts)."                              â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                                                                                                                                    â”‚
â”‚  So for the third quarter guidance, it's a forecast, so is_factual is N. But the actual second quarter results are factual.                                                                                        â”‚

â”‚  Let me check all sentences again for factual vs. projected.                                                                                                                                                       â”‚
