# Example: Using LLMs to Analyze Key Metric Forecasts and Their Drivers in Earnings Call Transcripts
> [!NOTE]
> In earnings calls, management usually shares their outlook on the company's future. These projections are often the focus of analystsâ€™ repeated questions during the Q&A session. Manually reading through lengthy transcripts to extract such outlooks can be very time-consuming.
> 
> This document explains how to use large language models (LLMs) to analyze managementâ€™s future outlook. Compared to manual analysis, LLMs can complete the same task in just seconds, providing a clear and traceable reasoning process for review.

## Prerequisites
To run this example, you need: 
1. An OpenAI-compatible API key (`OPEN_AI_API_KEY`)
2. A LLM model with a function call tools capability.
3. A LLM model with a thinking capability.

> [!TIP]
> Our tests were conducted using the [Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking) model, achieving over 99% recall and 100% accuracy.
> 
> For optimal results, it is recommended to use large language models with large parameters.

## Example Code
**Below is an example that analyzes key quarterly financial forecast and their causes, using an LLM on earnings call transcripts.**

```python
from openai import OpenAI
from defeatbeta_api.data.ticker import Ticker
from defeatbeta_api.client.openai_conf import OpenAIConfiguration

# Initialize the Ticker
ticker = Ticker("AMD")

# Fetch earnings call transcripts
transcripts = ticker.earning_call_transcripts()

# Configure the OpenAI client
llm = OpenAI(
    api_key="OPEN_AI_API_KEY",  # Replace with your OPEN_AI_API_KEY
    base_url="OPEN_AI_API_END_POINT"  # Replace with your OPEN_AI_API_END_POINT
)

# analyzes key quarterly financial forecast and their causes for Q2 2025 with llm
res = transcripts.analyze_financial_metrics_forecast_for_future_with_ai(
  2025, 
  2, 
  llm, 
  OpenAIConfiguration(model='Qwen/Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking'))

print(res.to_string())
```

â”‚  segment, with Client revenue increasing and the Gaming revenue to be flattish; and our Embedded segment revenue to return to growth."                                                                             â”‚
â”‚  4. "54% gross margin" - Reason: "We do have some tailwinds we have been really driving. First is we have been expanding our server business, which has really nice gross margin. And on the Client business       â”‚
â”‚  side, we are expanding the commercial PC business, so that really helps us to drive the gross margin up. In addition, we do have a really strong operational team. They are driving the gross margin improvement  â”‚
â”‚  just from an operational efficiency perspective across the board."                                                                                                                                                â”‚
â”‚  5. "$2.55 billion operating expenses" - Reason: "We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $2.55 billion." (This is a forecast but doesn't have a specific reason mentioned)                      â”‚
â”‚  6. "$10 million gain" - Reason: "We expect net interest and other expenses to be a gain of approximately $10 million." (This is a forecast but doesn't have a specific reason mentioned)                          â”‚
â”‚  7. "13% effective tax rate" - Reason: "We expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 13%." (This is a forecast but doesn't have a specific reason mentioned)                                                    â”‚
â”‚  8. "1.63 billion shares" - Reason: "diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.63 billion shares." (This is a forecast but doesn't have a specific reason mentioned)                                   â”‚
â”‚  9. "grow year-on-year from last year" - Reason: "MI355, we actually started production in June. So we had some shipments sort of in the month of June, but it really is ramping as we go through this quarter     â”‚
â”‚  and the third quarter."                                                                                                                                                                                           â”‚
â”‚  10. "adoption is a bit faster than we might have expected" - Reason: "I think the adoption is a bit faster than we might have expected. Again, whenever you launch a product, we want to make sure that we go     â”‚
â”‚  through the full validation and all of that with our customers. I think there's a lot of interest -- broad-based interest in MI355."                                                                              â”‚
â”‚  11. "single-digit type growth" - Reason: "We do expect the -- some growth -- sequential growth in clients as we go into the third quarter, I would say sort of single-digit type growth."                         â”‚
â”‚  12. "flattish to Q2" - Reason: "On the Gaming side, I would call it flattish to Q2."                                                                                                                              â”‚
â”‚  13. "down strong double digits" - Reason: "As we go into the fourth quarter, the dynamics that we would see is we would see that the console business would actually be down substantially, so think about it as  â”‚
â”‚  down strong double digits."                                                                                                                                                                                       â”‚
â”‚  14. "8, 9 months" - Reason: "Our lead times are long, given all of the processing steps that we have to go through. Think about it as somewhere between 8, 9 months, that type of thing."                         â”‚
â”‚  15. "Q3 gross margin around 54%" - Reason: "We do have some tailwinds we have been really driving. First is we have been expanding our server business, which has really nice gross margin. And on the Client     â”‚
â”‚  business side, we are expanding the commercial PC business, so that really helps us to drive the gross margin up. In addition, we do have a really strong operational team. They are driving the gross margin     â”‚
â”‚  improvement just from an operational efficiency perspective across the board."                                                                                                                                    â”‚
â”‚  16. "tens of billions of dollars" - Reason: "I think when we get to tens of billions of dollars, we're talking about significant gigawatt-scale type deployments. And those would be important for us to get      â”‚
â”‚  there. And we're certainly, I think, engaged with all of the right customers that can enable that type of ramp."                                                                                                  â”‚
â”‚  17. "strong double-digit growth" - Reason: "We do have a strong double-digit growth, both in server and MI. Both sides are growing sequentially."                                                                 â”‚
â”‚  18. "more robust forecasts going out a number of quarters on the server CPU side" - Reason: "We started to see more robust forecasts going out a number of quarters on the server CPU side because all of that    â”‚
â”‚  AI content really requires traditional CPUs as well."                                                                                                                                                             â”‚
â”‚  19. "significant revenue contribution from Helios in 2026" - Reason: "We would expect significant revenue contribution from Helios in 2026."                                                                      â”‚
â”‚  20. "$1.2 billion free cash flow" - Reason: "As you see in Q2, free cash flow generation was $1.2 billion."                                                                                                       â”‚
â”‚  21. "strong double-digit increase" - Reason: "We see Data Center a strong double-digit increase, which include both GPU and CPU, but GPU definitely drives largest incremental amount increase."                  â”‚
â”‚                                                                                                                                                                                                                    â”‚

I think when we get to tens of billions of dollars, we're talking about significant gigawatt-scale type deployments. And those would be important for us to get there. And we're certainly, I think, engaged with all of the right customers that can enable that type of ramp.
