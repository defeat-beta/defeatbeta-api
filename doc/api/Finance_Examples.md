## 5. Stock Beta

Calculate beta (β) to measure a stock's volatility relative to the market. Beta uses monthly returns for periods ≥ 1 year (industry standard) and daily returns for shorter periods.

### 5.1 Basic Usage - 5 Year Beta (Default)
```python
ticker.beta()
```
```text
>>> ticker.beta()
2.8103
```

### 5.2 Different Time Periods
```python
# 1 year beta (12 monthly returns)
ticker.beta("1y")

# 3 year beta (36 monthly returns)
ticker.beta("3y")

# 5 year beta (60 monthly returns)
ticker.beta("5y")

# Short-term: 3 months (daily returns)
ticker.beta("3m")

# Short-term: 30 days (daily returns)
ticker.beta("30d")
```
```text
>>> ticker.beta("1y")
3.1245

>>> ticker.beta("3y")
2.9567

>>> ticker.beta("5y")
2.8103

>>> ticker.beta("3m")
2.6891

>>> ticker.beta("30d")
2.4567
```

### 5.3 Different Benchmark Index
```python
# Compare to S&P 500 (default)
ticker.beta("5y", benchmark="SPY")

# Compare to NASDAQ-100
ticker.beta("5y", benchmark="QQQ")

# Compare to Russell 2000
ticker.beta("5y", benchmark="IWM")
```
```text
>>> ticker.beta("5y", benchmark="SPY")
2.8103

>>> ticker.beta("5y", benchmark="QQQ")
2.6542

>>> ticker.beta("5y", benchmark="IWM")
2.4321
```

### 5.4 Understanding Beta Values
- **β = 1.0**: Stock moves with the market
- **β > 1.0**: Stock is more volatile than the market (higher risk/reward)
- **β < 1.0**: Stock is less volatile than the market (lower risk/reward)
- **β < 0.0**: Stock moves inversely to the market

**Calculation Method:**
- For periods ≥ 1 year: Uses monthly returns (e.g., 60 months for 5 years)
- For periods < 1 year: Uses daily returns
- Formula: `β = Covariance(Stock Returns, Market Returns) / Variance(Market Returns)`
